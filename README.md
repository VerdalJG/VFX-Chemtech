# VFX-Chemtech

This is a small project that I used as a first experience with VFX in Unity. In the project, I made VFX that belonged in a League of Legends skin line known as Chemtech. I used Volibear as the character because I wanted to work with his ultimate ability, Stormbringer. In the base ability, Volibear jumps up and crashes on the ground leaving a massive crater of electricity.

For my variation, I decided to use the chemtech skin line, featuring a poisonous chemical greenish look, achieved by working on a smoke cloud effect in Adobe After Effects as well as visual effect graphs in Unity.

Since chemtech was also referred to in Riot's series "Arcane", I also decided to reference it by making an outer ring of mechanical butterflies around the crater.
